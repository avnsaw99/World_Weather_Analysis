# Project Reflection

With this project, I was able to understand the importance of JSON as well as Python, for building powerful data analysis tools that also can use APIs. I think what fascinated me the most was how the code is not as challenging as I thought it would be. What I found particularly cool is how can we keep the API call volume below 60 everytime its ran to avoid charges, thats a neat programming trick

Personally, I am very behind, and my grade has taken a major hit. However, I have every intention of finally sealing the gap
